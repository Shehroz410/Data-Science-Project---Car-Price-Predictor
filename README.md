# 🚗 Car Price Predictor – A Data Science & Machine Learning Project

## 🔍 Overview

The **Car Price Predictor** is a machine learning-based project that predicts the selling price of a car using several features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. This project demonstrates the entire data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and visualization to model training, evaluation, and deployment.


## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit

## 📊 Features

- Clean and preprocess raw car data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple regression models
- Evaluate using R², MSE, MAE
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit to predict prices
